This directory contains programs for working with RDOFF version 1 object
files. RDOFF version 1 is no longer supported - you should now be using 
RDOFF2. If you are working with your own code, the changes you will need
to make are very simple, and are outlined in the document Changes in the
nasm/rdoff directory.
